    "\n",
    "Point clouds are more memory efficient than meshes as they only contain point coordinates whether meshes have point coordinates as well as the face connectivity information. Points are also more suitable for neural network based shape prediciton as well as while working with changing connectivity. However, point clouds produce low quality renders due to the voids in between the points whereas meshes contain connectivity information thats fills the gaps between the points. Meshes are also very compatible with most 3D simulation based softwares.  \n",
